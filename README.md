# Freight Cost Analysis Dashboard

## Project Summary
This project analyzes freight and logistics cost performance using Excel. The dashboard identifies cost overruns, delivery delays, and SLA compliance issues to support operational and cost-optimization decisions.

## Business Problem
Freight costs are increasing while delivery performance remains inconsistent. Without clear visibility into cost drivers and delivery outcomes, logistics teams struggle to identify inefficiencies and enforce SLA accountability.

## Solution
An interactive Excel dashboard that consolidates freight cost and delivery performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to quickly:
- Detect cost overruns  
- Monitor delivery delays  
- Evaluate carrier SLA compliance  
- Identify high-risk routes and carriers  

## Key Metrics
- Total Freight Cost  
- Average Cost per Shipment  
- Cost Overrun (%)  
- On-Time Delivery Rate  
- Delayed Shipments  
- SLA Compliance Rate  

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive slicers for Date, Route, Carrier, and Delivery Status  
- Dynamic KPI cards that update instantly based on filters  
- Clear visual distinction between cost analysis and delivery performance  
- Business-focused layout designed for fast insight consumption  

## Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Pivot Charts  
  - Slicers  
  - Conditional Formatting  

All data cleaning and transformation were performed in Excel.

## Key Insights
- A small number of routes consistently exceed freight cost targets  
- Delayed deliveries significantly contribute to cost overruns  
- Carrier performance varies widely, with repeated SLA breaches from specific providers  
- Improving delivery timeliness directly reduces overall freight spend  

## Impact
This dashboard enables:
- Better freight cost control  
- Improved carrier performance monitoring  
- Increased SLA compliance  
- Faster, data-driven logistics decisions  

## How to Use
1. Download and open the Excel file  
2. Use slicers to filter by route, carrier, date, or delivery status  
3. Review KPIs and trend charts  
4. Focus on cost overruns and SLA breaches for action  

## Future Improvements
- Integration with Power BI for real-time updates  
- Automated data refresh  
- Deeper carrier-level cost analysis
